                            The Nigeria Christian Corpers’ Fellowship is a provision God made in fulfillment of his prophecy given by the well-known British missionary to Nigeria, Pa Sydney Granville Elton in the 1930s. The prophecy states that, <b><i>“A time will come when Nigeria will pay her youths to preach the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ in the nooks and crannies of the nation”.</b></i> This prophecy tarried for some years, however in the year 1973, during the regime of the then Head of State, General Yakubu Gowon, with a view to the proper encouragement and development of common ties among the youths of Nigeria and the promotion of national unity the National Youth Service Corps scheme was established, Ignorant of the prophecy but under God’s direction, Christian Corp Members were committed to : Prayer, Bible study, Witnessing Christ and Fellowship in all the NYSC orientation camps across the nation and the fellowship continued everywhere these corp members were posted to. <br>
                        </p>

                            Delta State, located in southern Nigeria, was created on August 27, 1991, when it was carved out of the former Bendel State. Its history is intertwined with the colonial and post-colonial developments in Nigeria. Before its creation, the area that is now Delta State was part of the Western Region of Nigeria during the British colonial period, and later, it became part of the Mid-Western Region after Nigeria gained independence in 1960.

                            The region is ethnically diverse, with major groups including the Urhobo, Itsekiri, Ijaw, Isoko, and Anioma peoples. Each of these groups has its own unique cultural and historical heritage. Delta State is also rich in natural resources, notably crude oil and natural gas, making it a significant contributor to Nigeria's economy.
                        </p>    
                        <p align="justify">The entry of the Nigeria Christian Corpers' Fellowship (NCCF) into Delta State is part of a broader narrative of the spread of Christianity in Nigeria. The NCCF, a Christian organization that caters to the spiritual needs of members of the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC), has its roots in the evangelical movements that swept through Nigeria in the latter half of the 20th century. The fellowship provides a platform for Christian Corpers to connect, worship, and engage in community service during their service year.
                        
                            The presence of the NCCF in Delta State likely began soon after the state's creation, as part of the fellowship's nationwide expansion. The NCCF in Delta State has been involved in various community development projects, evangelism, and providing a support system for Christian youth corpers. It has played a role in fostering unity and understanding among corpers from different ethnic and religious backgrounds, reflecting the diverse nature of Delta State itself.

        <p align="justify">
         The Nigeria Christian Corpers’ Fellowship (NCCF) is a body of Christian members who are dedicated to serving God and humanity within their service year, we are a fellowship that accommodates Christian corps members and helps in focusing their relationship with God irrespective of their gender, tribe and denomination. NCCF is an inter-denominational and non-denominational fellowship comprising of Christian corpers cutting across different denominations. We are popularly referred to as JESUS CORPERS.</p>

          <p>NCCF as a body is tripartite in nature: first a fellowship (as it started in 1973 at the various orientation camps, where corp members met to pray together, study together, witness Christ and share fellowship with one another), then it became a duly registered and recognized organization (in the year 1990, with the Corporate Affairs Commission in accordance to the Company and Matters Allied Acts, Decree No 1 of 1990, it has a corporate and distinct identity, has structures at National, State and Zonal levels) and it also runs as a family (progressively as corp members were posted to different locations within the states and other corpers from subsequent batches are posted to those locations, divine providence brought them  together and they started to live together as a family and share fellowship)                    </p>

We seek to achieve this vision by providing a platform for spiritual growth, character development, and leadership training for Christian youth serving as National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) members. NCCF envisions a Nigeria where Christian corpers, through their exemplary lives, influence society with godly values, promote unity, and contribute to nation-building. The organization aims to empower corpers to become agents of positive change in their respective communities, workplaces, and spheres of influence. </p>

NCCF encourages corpers to live out their faith, embodying Christ-like love, integrity, and servant leadership. In pursuing its vision, NCCF provides various programs and activities such as Bible studies, discipleship training, leadership conferences, community development projects, and outreach initiatives. These programs are designed to equip corpers spiritually, intellectually, and emotionally, enabling them to navigate the challenges they may face during their service year and beyond. Our vision of the Nigeria Christian Corpers' Fellowship is to mobilize and empower Christian corpers to be transformational leaders, making a positive difference in society and advancing the Kingdom of God in Nigeria.</p>

                                Our commitment at the Nigeria Christian Corpers Fellowship extends beyond regular fellowship meetings. We actively engage in compassionate outreach programs, ensuring our presence is felt and valued in various segments of the community. Key among our initiatives is our routine visits to prisons, orphanages, less-privileged homes, and hospitals. These visits are not just symbolic; they are opportunities for us to extend the love and care that are fundamental in reaching out to people for God.

In each visit, we bring not only our presence and prayers but also tangible expressions of our love and concern. This is realized through the distribution of gifts and relief materials, specifically chosen to meet the immediate needs of those we are serving. Whether it's providing essential items to those in hospitals or bringing toys and educational materials to children in orphanages, each item is a token of our commitment to sharing God's love in practical ways.

<br>Additionally, our outreach extends to neighborhood and market evangelism. We believe in meeting people right where they are, engaging with them in their everyday environments. Through these interactions, we share the message of hope and faith, impacting lives one person at a time.
