                <h2 class="text-center wow fadeInDown">HISTORY</h2>
                <p class="text-center wow fadeInDown">In the year 1986, American Missionaries Gary and Harriet Ham observed that their teenage sons did not understand the messages and the proceedings of normal services in church. They both wondered why and sought to prayerfully seek a solution to their observation. They eventually came up with the idea of organising Sunday school for teenagers. They thought of doing it in way that it will appeal to their group. The Teenage group thrived for a while but the need to become more formal became a necessity. The couple now sought the advice and permission of the Archbishop Most Rev Prof. Benson Idahosa JP. The Archbishop gave his blessi9ngs andn the group was named Agape Force.</p>
                <p>The young group grew steadily as they organised picnics, bible and academic quiz, games and other activities that help facilitate fellowship. That was mainly Faith Arena in the years 1986-1988. It started in Miracle Center in 1986 before C.G.M. Headquarter moved to Faith Arena that same year.
                </p>
                <p>The time then came for the Missionaries to go back to America. The question was: who will now be the new leader? Deacon Ogbe Oviaesu was asked to take over; he however requested to be allowed to remain with the children’s Department. The Archbishop commissioned three young ministers namely – Rev Humphery Areghan, Rev Francis Umemezia and Rev Festus Akhimien. As God would have it, Rev Humphery Areghan took up the mantle of leadership in the year 1988. He got started a teenage executive and got the group recognizsed in the Church Council and Constitution. He was named the National Director of the group and got the group established in the main branches of Church of God Mission nation wide. In 1991 the group had the first national camp meeting and more other camp meetings were organised in the preceeding years ( the first camp meeting was held in 1991 with less than 100 campers). In the year 1993, he formed a national leadership that comprises of Zonal Coordinators to oversee the branches from Headquarters to the grassroots.</p>
                <p>Today, over 25 years later the group is well established in most of the branches both in the cities and rural areas and several sister churches. It had also become the pioneering church based teenage group in the country. It has produced many generations of leader that the Church is proud of. Men like Pastor Andrew Abiodu who was the first President, Rev and Mrs Ubamadu, Rev Wale Ajayi, Rev James Areghan, Rev Osas Obarisiagbon, Rev Tobe Godson, Martins Ugege, Rev Henry Maido, The Okhuoyas and a whole lot of others across the globe doing very well.
                </p>
                <p>The group has carried out a lot of outreach to rural areas around Benin City and have been involved in some community projects. The rural the rural communities include Ekenwan barrack ( the church there was given a roof), Egor village Abudu village Aihuobakun village where a borehole project is ongoing and many other communities. </p>

         <h4>Vision Statement: </h4>
              <p>To build people into leadership with a global passion deeply rooted in Christ.</p>
              <p>The missions outreach is an arm of Church of God Mission Int’l that focuses on evangelizing the unreached people groups, with the aim of transforming lives through an in-depth undiluted teaching of the word of God. Thus raising end time soldiers that will impact their world for Christ</p>
              <p>Our evangelistic strategies include: opening of schools, free medicare, provision of portable water, supply of relief materials where needed, free skill acquisition programs, etc. And these by the grace of God, we have done over the years with great results and testimonies. Our major targets are the animist, idol worshippers, the Muslims and nominal Christians. In view of this in mind, therefore, we have so far evangelized among some people groups in Adamawa State, Edo State, Taraba State, Plateau State, Kogi State, some parts of Western and Eastern regions. In addition, we are working among the Hausa/Fulani people groups of the Northern region.</p>
              <p>In some of these places, churches have been planted and missionaries are on ground to nurture them to maturity. The nurtured churches have been handed over to the indigenous believers who are equally working hard reaching their own people with the gospel message of Christ</p>
              <h4>Challenges</h4>
              <p>The churches in Danacha, Wukari in Taraba State, Ikere-Ekiti in Ekiti State, Abocho in Benue State, Bokkos in Plateau State, are yet to get a befitting place of worship. For some, the building project is ongoing and we need finance for the completion. In addition to this, we are in need of mobility-motor cycles, bicycles, and cars, etc for our pastors and missionaries to ease their movement into the very interior villages to touch lives. While some of our churches need musical instruments for praise/worship.</p>
                  <div class="row">
						<div class="col-md-4">
							<img src="images/missions_header.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="About">
						</div>
						<div class="col-md-8">
                            <br>
        <p>Furthermore, because of the present activities of the Bokko Haram Islamic Fundamentalists and terrorists in the Northern part of Nigeria, where Christians and missionaries have become the object of constant attack, most Mission Agencies including ours, have withdrawn their missionaries from the fields for safety leaving the work there stagnant. This indeed is a major challenge which calls for fervent prayers for peace to be restored.</p>
            </div>
					</div>
            <h4>Testimonies</h4>
              <p>Ever since the work started, so many testimonies have been recorded in our various fields and the name of God is gloried. The medical team visited Agbede in Edo State were free cataract operation were conducted with great success and testimonies. Among others was the case of a particular woman who had lost her sight to cataract which eventually led to her marriage been broken. However, after the operation she regained her sight and her marriage too was restored. Praise God! </p>
              <p>In Oko village in Edo State, schools were supplied with desks and chairs for pupils who were sitting on bare floor to study</p>
              <p>In addition, few jobless youths were empowered in Ebedebiri in Bayelsa State when they were presented with motor cycles for commercial purpose.</p>
              <p>And of course these and many more physical demonstration of the love of Christ made many to willingly surrender their lives to Christ. Many more communities are already calling on us to come. However, for financial constraints, we would have loved to do more.</p>
              <h4>Conclusion</h4>
              <p>Do you know countless of people in the world live each day without hope? Countless people are held bound by the clutches of the enemy, countless souls die each day without giving their hearts to Christ Jesus. This is the time for us to see the world through the eyes of God and rescue the perishing. It is our conviction that every Christian should be a mirror reflecting the image and likeness of Christ to the world and our Mission Agency should be a beacon of light bearing the burden of the nations on her shoulders. The era of waiting for foreign missionaries is over. The baton has been handed over to us to reach the unreached people groups with the message of truth. For how long are we going to continue to pray for the Lord of harvest to send labourers into the field? The field indeed is white unto harvest. The Lord is counting on us as His co-labourers because there are still more territories to conquer and more souls to be saved.</p>
              <p>For these to be successful, we need your supports--human support, those who will volunteer as missionaries to the fields, financial and prayer supports etc.</p>
